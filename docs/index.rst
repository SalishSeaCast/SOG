Welcome to the SOG documentation!
=================================

SOG is a
vertical,
one-dimensional,
coupled physics-biology model
for deep estuaries.
It is a local model of the lower trophic-level ecology and
carbon/oxygen/nitrogen cycles that is based on a simplified,
but accurate,
physical model.
SOG is being used to investigate the processes that determine primary
productivity and carbon fluxes.

SOG is developed by `Dr. Susan Allen's`_ `Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics group`_
in the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences
at the Univeristy of British Columbia.
