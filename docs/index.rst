Welcome to the SOG documentation!
=================================

SOG is a
vertical,
one-dimensional,
coupled physics-biogeochemical model for deep estuaries.
It is a local model of the lower trophic-level ecology and carbon/oxygen/nitrogen cycles that is based on a simplified,
but accurate,
physical model.
SOG is being used to investigate the processes that determine primary productivity and carbon fluxes.

SOG is developed by `Dr. Susan Allen's`_ `Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics group`_ in the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at the Univeristy of British Columbia.
