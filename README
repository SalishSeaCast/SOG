========================================
 SOG Code Development & Run Environment
========================================

This is the root repository for development and running of the SOG_
coupled biology-physics model of deep esturaries.

.. _SOG: http://bjossa.eos.ubc.ca:9000/SOG/

SOG is maintained in a set of Mercurial_ distributed version control
repositories. The central, reference copies of those repositories are
stored in :file:`/ocean/sallen/hg_repos/`

.. _Mercurial: http://mercurial.selenic.com/

If you're impatient, you can get a fresh SOG environment set up with
the commands:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ hg clone /ocean/sallen/hg_repos/SOG
   $ cd SOG
   $ make env

This will create a SOG environment in a directory called SOG. The
environment looks like this::

  SOG/
           SOG-code-ocean/ - reference copy of the SOG-code repository
           SOG-code-dev/ - clone of SOG-code-ocean for code development work
           SOG-initial/ - SOG initialization data repository
           SOG-forcing/ - SOG forcing data repository
           SOG-project/ - directory for doing SOG runs in
                                 profiles/ - profile output files
                                 timeseries/ - timeseries output file

For details of the recommended workflow in this environment, and how
to customize it, read on...


Create a SOG Environment with a Different Name
==============================================

To create a fresh SOG environment with called something other than
`SOG` use the commands:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ hg clone /ocean/sallen/hg_repos/SOG newSOG
   $ cd newSOG
   $ make env


Create a SOG Environment on a non-`ocean` Computer
==================================================

Assuming that you have an account on `ocean` and have :command:`ssh`
key access set up, you can set up a fresh SOG environment with the
commands:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ hg clone ssh://<user>@<host>.eos.ubc.ca//ocean/sallen/hg_repos/SOG
   $ cd SOG
   $ make env HG_REPOS=ssh://<user>@<host>.eos.ubc.ca//ocean/sallen/hg_repos

where <user> is your `ocean` user id, and <host> is the name of one of
the `ocean` computers; e.g. `nerka`, `grinder`, `herring`.
